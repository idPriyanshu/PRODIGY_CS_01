# 🚀 PRODIGY_CS_01

## 📝 Task Overview

**Task:** Implement Caesar Cipher  
**Description:** Create a Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value for encryption and decryption.  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🌟 Beyond the Task: Additional Ciphers

To enhance the project, I implemented the following ciphers:  
- 🛡️ Caesar Cipher  
- ✏️ Affine Cipher  
- 🔐 Pig Pen Cipher  
- 📡 Morse Code  
- 🌀 Atbash Cipher  
- 📏 Rail Fence Cipher  
- 🗺️ Polybius Cipher  
- 🔍 Bifid Cipher  
- 🔑 Vigenère Cipher  
- 🧩 Columnar Transposition Cipher  

These implementations go beyond the basic requirements of the task, providing additional functionality and exploring various cryptographic techniques.
